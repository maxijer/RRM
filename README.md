# RRM
## What's in this repository?
This repository contains my article on solving the problem of radio resource management
## Where code?
Unfortunately I don't really want to publish the code of the simulator itself, because it was time-consuming work on it and I don't really want to upload it to open source, but if you are interested
## How do I find out more about the simulator you wrote and find the code?
You can always write to me on the social network with questions. But in this repository you can read the contents of the article.
### To read the article, you need to open the file Scheduling algorithms in cellular MIMO systems.pdf
